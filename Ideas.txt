A slightly more complicated example that will download asynchronously or "in the background" by PeterMonty. I've tried to keep it as similar to the one above as possible for comparison.
// Starts download
- (void)download
{
	NSURL *myURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.apple.com/"];
	[myURL loadResourceDataNotifyingClient:self usingCache:YES];
}

// This method will be called when the download has finished
- (void)URLResourceDidFinishLoading:(NSURL *)sender
{
	NSData *urlContents = [sender resourceDataUsingCache:YES];

	if ([urlContents writeToFile:[@"~/Documents/applewebsite.html"
                         stringByExpandingTildeInPath]
                         atomically:YES])
	{
		// It was successful, do stuff here
	} else {
		// There was a problem writing the file
	}
}

anImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@"image.jpg"];
[NSApp setApplicationIconImage:anImage];
